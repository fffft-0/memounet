> **Abstract** *Wave height prediction is a typical spatiotemporal modeling task. It predicts future changes by modeling the spatiotemporal evolution pattern of historical information. UNet is one of the classical deep learning models that can effectively model the pattern of spatiotemporal evolution, and has received a lot of attention in the wave height prediction domain. However, there is a lack of utilization of historical information in UNet, and it is difficult to depict the time characteristics accurately. In this paper, we propose a Memo-UNet with an updatable Memo module and a TimeEncoding module for wave height prediction. Specifically, to address the issue of the lack of historical information, the updatable Memo module is used to enhance the dynamic evolution of key historical node information. Additionally, a TimeEncoding module and attention mechanisms are then incorporated to provide implicit temporal feature representations. We validated the proposed method with different marine regions for wave height prediction. The tested results showed that our method achieved an average 7.7\% improvement compared with the state-of-the-art prediction methods. In addition, we also tested the proposed method on classical spatiotemporal modeling tasks, and we obtained the highest performance across multiple metrics.*
